# Random
Collection of random programming stuff.

Some of the stuff is unfinished. Will it be finished? I don't know...Made this to show people/archive of some stuff I've been working on/learning about. Most stuff is from before junior year at UMass.

### Notable Notebooks:
* Image Compression Project
* Differential Equations and Some...(messy, QR algorithm has no Householder Transformations,  I used 4/5th order Runge-Kutta in Traffic Flow Project)
* Basic Cryptography
* RSA Algorithm
* Genetic Algorithm (made before CS383)
* Lotka-Volterra - Predator Prey
* Standard Young Tableau
* Mersenne Primes (not very interesting/clean but I accidentally found evidence of the Prime Number Theorem)
* Stocks (my initial attempt at evaluating stocks... haven't touched that in a while)

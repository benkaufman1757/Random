# Random
Collection of random programming stuff.

Some of the stuff is unfinished. Will it be finished? I don't know...Made this as a slightly more organized archive of some stuff I've been working on/learning about.

### Notable Notebooks:
* Basic Cryptography
* RSA Algorithm
* Genetic Algorithm
* Standard Young Tableau
* Mersenne Primes (not very interesting/clean but I accidentally found evidence of the Prime Number Theorem)
* Stocks (my initial attempt at evaluating stocks... haven't touched that in a while)

### TO-DO
* Upload/fix-up OpenCV/Skimage stuff
* LSD-Slam

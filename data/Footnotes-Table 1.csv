Things to consider when interpreting the data:,,,,,
,,,,,
*How gross lottery proceeds were spent in 2013: 72 percent was returned to players in the form of prizes; 5.7 percent was given to retailers as commissions and bonuses; 1.9 percent covered administrative costs; and 19.7 percent was net profit that was funneled into the Unrestricted General Government Aid fund.,,,,,
,,,,,
"*The total Unrestricted General Government Aid was 96.7 percent funded by the Massachusetts State Lottery in 2013. That does not mean, however, that individual disbursements followed that ratio, as many communities received need-based additional assistance.",,,,,
,,,,,
"*Unrestricted General Government Aid distribution follows a legislative formula based on a municipality's population and equalized property valuation, or the government's estimate of the fair cash value of all taxable properties. The formula has not been run since fiscal year 2009, said Bo Zhao, senior economist at the New England Public Policy Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.",,,,,

*Unrestricted General Government Aid totals do not include Chapter 70 education state aid and state-owned land reimbursements.,,,,,
